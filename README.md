# Space Pixels

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

Space Pixels is a 2D Shoot'Em Up game developed in C.

The code available in this repository corresponds to a project template / basecode provided to students of ESIEA as a final semester project.
As such, the game is not feature-complete: it is intended to be extended, improved, and completed by students.
A [quick start guide](docs/quick_start_fr.md) (in French) is provided in the `docs/` folder to help students get started with the codebase.

## Demo

The repository contains basecode only.

A demonstration binary showing a possible finished version of the game is available in the Releases section.
This demo is provided for reference only and may differ from the basecode in this repository.
The demo executable is currently compiled for Windows in 64 bits.

## Features

- Minimal 2D engine in C using SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_ttf, SDL3_mixer and cJSON.
- UI system with buttons, lists, labels, layouts and anchor-based positioning.
- Sprite sheet support, including 9-slice scaling and pixel-art rendering (see the [documentation](docs/sprite_sheet_json_fr.md) for details).
- Clean project layout suitable as a template for new SDL3 projects.
- Built-in asset obfuscation system:
  - Source assets are placed in `assets_dev/`.
  - The build system can automatically generate obfuscated copies.
  - Obfuscated assets are written to `assets/` and can be loaded normally via the `AssetManager`.

This repository provides a reusable game engine (`engine/`) and a sample application (`application/`) demonstrating UI, sprite sheets, input handling, scenes, and resource management.

## Recommended Build Setup

The recommended way to build the project is:

- Visual Studio 2026 (or newer)
- CMake version 4.1.2 or higher

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio 2026. Visual Studio automatically detects CMake projects.
3. Build and run the project from the IDE.

## Project layout

- `engine/` — static library with engine core: renderer, asset manager, UI components, utilities.
- `application/` — demo application (main, scenes, UI pages, asset registration).
- `third_party/` — optional local copies of SDL3 and cJSON used by MSVC builds.
- `assets_dev/` — images, sprite sheets and data used by the demo.
